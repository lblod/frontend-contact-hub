## Reference

### Feature flags

Feature flags are used to enable/disable features in the application. They are defined in [config/environment.js](config/environment.js).

```javascript
// in config/environment.js
let ENV = {
  // Other configuration settings...
  features: {
    "new-feature": true, // Enable the 'new-feature' by default
    "beta-feature": false, // Disable the 'beta-feature' by default
  },
};
```

The configuration can be manually overridden by adding a query parameter to the URL:

- `?feature-new-feature=false` to disable the 'new-feature'
- `?feature-beta-feature=true` to enable the 'beta-feature'

The overriding will be saved in a cookie, so it will persist across page reloads. The cookie can be cleared by adding `?clear-feature-overrides=true` to the URL.

The feature flags can be used in the application by injecting the `features` service and calling the `isEnabled` method.

```javascript
import { inject as service } from "@ember/service";

export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {
  @service features;

  doSomething() {
    if (this.features.isEnabled("new-feature")) {
      // Implement the logic for the new feature
      console.log("New feature is enabled!");
    } else {
      // Implement the logic for the default behavior without the new feature
      console.log("New feature is disabled!");
    }
  }
}
```

Or in template files by using the `is-feature-enabled` helper:

```handlebars
{{#if (is-feature-enabled "new-feature")}}
  <p>New feature is enabled!</p>
{{else}}
  <p>New feature is disabled!</p>
{{/if}}
```
